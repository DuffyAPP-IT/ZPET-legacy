Welcome To ZPET...
ZPET/Zero-Pin Extraction Toolkit is designed to parse information from a connected, locked iOS Device
in BFU (Before First Unlock) mode.

ZPET operates with a live device, and does not require prior dumping of the Root Filesystem.

ZPET does not modify any files on-device, and utilises SCP to returnm "FOI's"/Files Of Interest
for local parsing.

ZPET is designed to be used for demonstration purposes only to allow consumers to understand
what personal data is accessible on their own devices in an 'encrypted state'.

I assume you have already read the instruction manual for ZPET. If not, please give it a read
as it has some very important information, I promise!

Finally, enjoy, and please do @ me on Twitter with any questions or to let me know what you find! 

To see this prompt again, check out the welcome file in the current directory.
